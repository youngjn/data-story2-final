				<p>For me, if someone asks me what my favourite cuisine is, I can not answer since there are so many. However, in terms of ingredients, not the cuisine, I would definitely say meat. Just like me, it’s really hard to find who does not love meat. We can see how people think and treat meat by looking at the chart of the global meat production.</p>

			<img src="images/cow_ver2.png" alt="livestock illust">
			<p class="meatProcess">The meat that ends up on your customers’ dinner plates all starts with a chick, a piglet, or a calf. These animals are either bred and born onsite or purchased from farmers who specialize in organic livestock breeding. They’re then raised organically, which means they are fed all-organic diets with no GMO grain, and they’re never given hormones or antibiotics. Organic livestock are not kept in confinement for extended periods of time, and they’re often allowed to roam freely and graze just as they would in the wild.</p>

			<h3 class="thirdChart-title">SLAUGHTER</h3>
			<p class="meatProcess">Once the livestock has reached a minimum age and size, it is slaughtered as humanely as possible and processed into cuts immediately. In every single USDA-approved facility, there are inspectors on hand to oversee everything from animal welfare to food safety guidelines. In the best production facilities, trained butchers carefully carve the cuts that will later be packaged and delivered to stores and markets. This process requires adherence to several safety guidelines set forth by the USDA, and high-quality facilities will go above and beyond to exceed those guidelines.</p>

			<h3 class="thirdChart-title">PACKAGING</h3>
			<img src="images/packaging.png" alt="packaging illust">
			<p class="meatProcess">The cuts of meat are then packaged per each client’s unique specifications. Although MAP packaging is often recommended for the best possible presentation and color, other options include more traditional vacuum packaging and master bagging, as well. The meats are packaged safely into USDA-approved containers, and they’re then carefully stored in sanitary facilities.</p>

			<img src="images/production.png" class="icon productionIcon" alt="meat_production">
			<h3 class="thirdChart-title">SHIPPING & DELIVERY</h3>
			<p class="meatProcess">When market owners place their orders, each cut of meat is hand-selected from the warehouse and packed carefully into boxes designed to protect the products while they’re in shipment. Then, they’re loaded onto trucks for delivery to markets in your area. The best companies work hard to ensure that the products you order are locally-sourced, which means they’re as fresh as possible when they arrive.</p>

			<p class="meatProcess">The final stage in the meat production process involves choosing the right cuts for your customer’s needs and displaying them for sale in your store. When you choose high-quality, safe meat products that are raised organically in a local setting, you can rest assured that your customers will see and taste the difference in every single product they buy from your store. It’s vital to choose a meat processing company that pays close attention to every single detail; this allows you to sell only the best.</p>

				<p>The biggest issue with meat production is GreenHouse Gas emissions which is also known as GHG Emission. GreenHouse Gases trap heat from escaping so that the heat comes back naturally and it warms the planet again and again. So if GreenHouse Gas emissions increase, it means the temperature of the earth can increase too, and we all know that if the temperature goes up, that is not a good sign. Every step in meat production has some related task with this GreenHouse Gas. Because of the increase of GHG emissions, last 200 years, the temperature of the planet has increased by 1.0 Celsius. The main gases responsible for the greenhouse effect include <span class="red">carbon dioxide</span>, <span class="red">methane</span>, <span class="red">nitrous oxide</span>, and water vapor (which all occur naturally), and <span class="red">fluorinated gases</span> (which are synthetic).

				<p>Until this point, I was talking about all types of meat, including poultry meat, such as chicken or duck, pork, and beef. Now it is time to separate them. In terms of production, different types of meat production made different impact on GHG, they all have different amount of Green House Gas emission for each kg of production. Each kilogram, beef emits the most amount of GHG.

				<p>Some people argue that not having meat will impact positively on our planet, and some argue it doesn't have any impact. Now it is proved that consuming meat actually has negative effects our planet. However, if you love meat just like me, who just cannot live without meat, you can reduce your amount of consumption of meat just a little bit in your daily life to practice. Instead of meat, we can satisfy our daily protein needs also from foods like tofu, egg, and beans, etc. As much as I love meat, I also love this beautiful planet. I strongly believe that there should be something you can give up for the sake of loving.
